# Flight Delay Due to Weather Trend Analysis

## Question
How do the daily local weather trends at an airport pair impact the expected delay of a given flight between the two airports?
## Value of Exploration
24% of all US flights encountered a delay, and 19% of these delays were caused by weather. That means that 5% of all flights were delayed by weather in 2018. This is sure to impact our company’s travel plans. Analyzing this issue will help decrease the lost time of our employees due to flight delays. We expect to succeed because weather is a significant enough cause of flight delay that we believe the data will show a correlation between delay times and weather at the arrival or destination.

## Data Used
For this project we shall use two datasets:
*‘On-Time : Reporting Carrier On-Time Performance (1987-present)’ by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics
*‘Daily Summaries Station Details’ by the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration
Airports used in this analysis: ATL, LAX, ORD, DFW, DEN, JFK, SFO, SEA, LAS, MCO

These data sets will provide us with daily flight records for every flight occuring between the desired airports, as well as local weather at both the origin and destination airports. This will allow us to analyze the local weather trends of both origin and destination airports and understand the relationship this has to flight delays.

##Additional Exploration Questions
1.Based on a 7 day weather forecast, which day and airline should I fly to minimize the expected delay?
2.How do current weather trends impact the delay of future flights?
3.How do we minimize the expected cost of delays to the company?
